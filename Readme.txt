README:
The CSS Off Challenge is a competition for web developers to challenge their understanding of CSS and Javascript. The challenge is to create a webpage from a design (.psd) that covers almost every irritating area that web developers run into while creating websites. The goal is to create a clean, well-documented, working webpage that looks and functions as the design dictates. It is supposed to be a responsive design, so it should look good on different screen resolutions (computer, tablet, smart-phone). The design does not include roll-over effects, so the developer has to come up with ideas himself that will go along with the design. The competition is scored as follows:

CODE

Cleanliness -------------- 0-10
	0 All code (HTML/CSS/JS) is organized, readable, efficient and current...

Semantics 	-------------- 0-10
	0 Logical elements and class/ID names are used

Validation 	-------------- 0-10
	0 HTML will be validated with the W3C Markup Validation Service. 100% valid HTML isn't necessary but thoroughness is encouraged.

USER EXERIENCE

Match Original Design ---- 0-10
	0 Submission should match original design as closely as possible.

Accessibility + Good Choice Points - 0-10
	0 Smart choices - Covers any accessibility concerns, Elements that should be text are text, buttons are flexible, rollovers look good, etc.

Interactions
	0 Additional states (rollovers, focus, etc) are not in place in the original design. These should be treated in a way that is consistent with the original design.

BROWSER SUPPORT & OPTIMIZATION

Modern Browser Support
	0 Submissions should render well in: Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and IE 10

Legacy Browser Support
	0 Submission should gracefully degrade in IE8

Overall Project Size
	0 The largest (reasonable) entries will receive a 1, the smallest receive a 10.

Resource Optimization
	0 Files, fonts, images, and code should be optimized for speed and efficiency.

RESPONSIVENESS

Responsive Implementation
	0 The submission should be responsive across multiple form factors and platforms.
